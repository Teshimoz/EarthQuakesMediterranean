<b>Project description:</b><br>
Earthquakes in Mediterranean area since 1900 through 2022, above magnitude 4.5. <br>Visualisation of earthquakes data and of Gutenberg–Richter law.
<br><br>
The data is from US Geological Survey - https://earthquake.usgs.gov/

<i>Remark<br>
There is a charpter about earthquake predictions in the book 'The Signal and the Noise' of Nate Silver. The bottom line is that we still can't predict events, like in meteorology. But we do have Gutenberg–Richter law:
looking on low-magnitude earthquakes frequences we can get an average frequency of bigger earthquaqes.
