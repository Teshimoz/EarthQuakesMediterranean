<b>Project description:</b><br>
The purpose was to approve that there is no trend in earthquakes, that they distributed equally in time.<br>
Used two methods:
* Tested maximum magnitudes distribution by Mann Whitney U test
* Illustrated the law of Guteberg-Richter on current data

Tools: pandas, matplotlib, scipy.stats, plotly, <a href='https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lev.drozdov/viz/Mediterraneanearthquakes/Dashboard'>Tableau</a>.<br>
The data is from US Geological Survey: earthquakes in Mediterranean area since 1900 through 2022, above magnitude 4.5.<br>

<i>Remark<br>
There is a charpter about earthquake predictions in the book 'The Signal and the Noise' of Nate Silver. The bottom line is that we still can't predict events, like in meteorology. But we do have Gutenbergâ€“Richter law:
looking on low-magnitude earthquakes frequences we can get an average frequency of bigger earthquaqes.</i>
